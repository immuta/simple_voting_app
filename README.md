# Voting Application

This is a simple voting application. We currently deploy it as two services.
One which allows the user to vote and one which allows the user to see the
results. In this case two different developers decided to work on the code and
they did it in two different languages. One decided to do the work in HAPI.js
and the other decided to do the work in python.

## Database
This application uses Redis as its backing data store.
